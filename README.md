## A new year of fun!
---
I have anticipated this date for a whole year, and today I get to participate in my favorite activity again! I am taking this opportunity to see how much I have progressed and to be amazed at how much I can learn. I feel a lot more comfortable doing administrative tasks nowadays compared to last year. I also grew tremendously in my knowledge of Git which is interesting. I feel the urge to learn algorithms in-depth as my New Year resolution. I also anticipated doing better documentation and organization for my projects.
